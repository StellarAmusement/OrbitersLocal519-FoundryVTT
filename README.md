## Development philosophy of this project

This is not a complete implementation of everything that is in the book.
I have not transcribed the items, arcana, or monsters.
You will still need the book to play.
The goal of the project is only to make Into the Odd playable in Foundry VTT.
One of the core mottos of the OSR is "Rulings, not rules".
It is important that the game system implementation does not get in the way of the GM when they want to make a ruling.
